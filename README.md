<H1>Infrastructure as a Code</h1>

These days the demand for creating everything in just few seconds is huge, there are several ways to do it in the market. When Infrastructure as code comes, 
Terraform is one of the most popular these days. The reason why could be the followings:

- Open source
- easy to use
- easy to learn
- independent from OS versions

But what exactly Infrastructure as a code is? \
*"Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical
hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."*

Says the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)

<h1>Terraform</h1>

The reason why I have chosen Terraform is relatively easy: based on my previous knowledge about technologies and tools I though I should learn Terraform next.
So far so good. It's unbelievably easy to learn. Just need to start and don't stop. *(ha-ha)*
But using it for smaller things such as build an infrastructure in AWS is really so easy. There's a nice tutorial on their official website as well as
many more beneficial materials.

<h2>Prerequisities</h2>

- need to have an AWS account
- also must be familiar with some services
- must be able to use bash shell confidently
- an IDE must be installed (Visual Studio in my case)

<h2>My first project</h2>

I decided to build a virtual private network and provision an instance which provides a web service.
